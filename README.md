_REPLACE OR REMOVE EVERYTING BETWEEN "\_"_

### Student Info

-   Name: Thomas Berrios
-   Section: 3

## Simulation Design

 - The simulation will be of planes and jets flying around in a battle.

### Controls

-   _List all of the actions the player can have in your simulation_
      - The player input would be launching a flak puff into the fight. It would be controlled by the mouse or possibly WASD to simulate the turret movement. If a plane/jet is hit by a flack puff, it would be destroyed.

## _Agent 1 Name_

_A brief explanation of this agent._

### _State 1 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
   - _If behavior has input data list it here_
   - _eg, Flee - nearest Agent2_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_
   - _eg, When this agent gets within range of Agent2_
   - _eg, When this agent has reached target of State2_

## Sources

-   _List all project sources here –models, textures, sound clips, assets, etc._
-   _If an asset is from the Unity store, include a link to the page and the author’s name_

## Make it Your Own

- _List out what you added to your game to make it different for you_
- _If you will add more agents or states make sure to list here and add it to the documention above_
- _If you will add your own assets make sure to list it here and add it to the Sources section

## Known Issues

_List any errors, lack of error checking, or specific information that I need to know to run your program_

### Requirements not completed

_If you did not complete a project requirement, notate that here_
